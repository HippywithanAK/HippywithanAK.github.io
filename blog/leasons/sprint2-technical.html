            <h3 id="margins">Margins</h3>
            <p>A margin is a space that exists outside of a css element.<br/> Margins will overlap with the margins of elements around them, so two elements with a margin of 1em sitting next to each other will have a space of 1em between them.<br/> The margin area of an element will not be interactive (you cant click in a margin).</p>
            </div>
            <div class="section">
            <h3 id="borders">Borders</h3>
            <p>A border surrounds an element and gives it shape. It can be given style, width, color and radius values.</br> Style desribes the type of line used to draw the border i.e. solid or dashed. Width determines the thickness of the border. Color is self-explanitory and radius will curve your element.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="section">
            <h3 id="padding">Padding</h3>
            <p>Padding refers to space inside of an element. Padding can't overlap with the padding of other elements, so 1em padding on adjacent elements will give a 2em gap. Padding will be recognised as interactive (clicking on an elements padding will trigger associated links).</p>
            </div>
            <div class="section">
            <h3 class="key-differences">Key differences</h3>
            <p>So, a margin is outside the element while padding is inside it and borders go around them. Padding will go inside a border while margins exist ourtside borders. Margins can't be clicked while padding can.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="section">
            <h3 id="summary">In summary</h3>
            <p>Margins are handy to use if you would like uniform spacing around elements, as the margins of elements won't stack. Padding will bulk out your element and borders help them stand out from surrounding content.</p>
