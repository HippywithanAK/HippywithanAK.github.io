            <h3>My long term goal and or career pathway?:</h3>
            <p>My long term goal is to forge a career in web development. To be a confident and competent full-stack developer. To continuously learn and improve my skills. The motivation behind this is financial stability and independence. And a genuine curiosity around coding.</p>

            <h3>Non-technical - human skills I would like to see myself develope while at EDA?</h3>
            <p>I would mostly like to build my understanding of co-operative projects. How work flow is organised and communication facilitated. These skills seem to be key to being able to competently execute complex projects.</p>

            <h3>Strengths and Limitations:</h3>
            <p>I am quick to understand core concepts but will sometimes rush to implement them before I have really planned things out. This can help me figure out what I do want to do but, I am often better served by laying out a specific set of steps in advance. This helps to keep track of where I’m up to and gives me at least a rough sketch of where I’m going.</p>

            <h3>How I will manage my workload in this programme. Whilst ensuring the safety of those around me.</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>I will plan out each sprint in advance and make every effort to stick to this plan.</li>
                <li>I will ensure that any work I commit to will be completed on time and to spec.</li>
                <li>If I feel that I may not be able to fulfil a commitment, I will communicate my concerns to anyone who might be effected, well in advance of it becoming a problem.</li>
                <li>I shall seek assistance early if I become stuck and I feel it may affect the work of others.</li>
                <li>I shall make myself available to assist others whenever possible. While ensuring my focus is on completing the work I have committed to.</li>
                <li>I shall avoid causing offence to anyone I come into contact with during this course. And will ensure my behaviour does not cause harm.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>My commitment as to how and where I will seek help in a timely way.</h3>
            <p>Should I find myself in a position where I feel unable to fulfil a commitment, I shall seek help, first with my team. Hopefully, a fresh set of eyes will help get me past the problem and at worst, the team may be able to adjust some roles in order to complete the work on time. If it is not a problem anyone in my cohort can help with I will seek help from a member of staff.</p>

            <h3>What I expect from the facilitation team</h3>
            <p>I expect the facilitation team to be available to help explain core concepts and help us if we are really stuck. I don’t expect them to hold our hands. </p>

            <h3>My scheduling information</h3>
            <p>My schedule is currently flexible. However I am looking for part time work. I will revisit this, should my situation change.</p>
