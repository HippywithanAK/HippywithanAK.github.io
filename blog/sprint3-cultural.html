                <h3>What is Emotional Intelligence?</h3>
                <p>Emotional Intellingence is a mesure of a person's ability to percieve, process, controll and respond appropriately.</p>

                <h3>How does it differ to IQ?</h3>
                    <p>Where IQ tests messure a persons competence at, tasks such as, abstract-reasoning, pattern recognition, arithmetic and recall. It does not provide any insite into the wide variety of social skills required for success in human society. This is where EQ comes in. It provides a measure, or perhaps more accuratly, a map, of of the ways we communicate with and relate to each other. </p>
                <h3>Why is EQ important? How is it relevant to me?</h3>
                    <p>EQ is important because we are social animals. Very little in this world can bew achieved alone. Therefore it is imperative that we are able to communicate effectivley with others. Understanding the way I, as an individual, interperate and respond to emotional cues, can help me effect more constructive reactions. By understanding and using emotion to bring out the best in ourselves and others, we can achieve tasks with less stress and more fulfilment. Developing a culture that makes work a place you want to be, because you feel appreciated and that your work is meaningful, you know you are part of a team, and that team is supportive and understanding, leads to: less sick days, more co-operation, greater willingness to go the extra mile and greater productivity. Not to mention, better, mental health. This sort of work culture can not exist without a general commitment to emotional awearness. So understanding and working to improve our EQ can have huge effects on our quality of life.</p>
