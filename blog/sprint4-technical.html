            <h3>Getting Blocked</h3>
            <p>
              I was working on some code that took a sentence as input, and if it had the word 'buzz' in it, it would remove 'buzz', then output the sentence exactly the same, except buzzless. 'Buzz' could be anywhere in the text and with random capitalisation. I was stuck trying to get my function to remove 'buzz' regardless of capitalisation. I tried explaining my code to my flatmate. This is known as the rubber duck method. While explaining how my code should change the word it is checking, to all lowercase, before asking if it is equal to 'buzz', requiring it's removal, I realised I was changing every word in the sentence to lowercase before removing 'buzz'. I had to make sure I checked if the word, changed to lowercase, was equal to 'buzz' and if not, output it unchanged, rather than change the word, then check it and return it if it wasn't "buzz". I was able to quickly refactor my code and get it working. My flatemate didn't even say a word. Just talking through it helped me see the solution. The process felt very natural. I'm comfortable with my flatemate and he was happy to help. It seemed like a very relaxed approach to problem solving. I learnt that verbalising what I want to acheive, actually, helps me visualise the steps involved.

            <h3>Solving with Style</h3>
            <p>
              I was writing some code, where I had a bunch of athletes, who were going to be competing in the olympics, and I needed to be able to tell the computer, that for every athlete, it should be able to print a 'Win Anouncement' announcing that, that, particular athlete had won at their particular sporting event. I was using a type of code called a for loop, to go through my list of athletes and give them some code, that would print their personalised message. It seemed to be returning the right message but it just wouldn't pass the pre-written test I had been asked to check it against. I tried doing some googling about for loops, to see if I was missing something. I still couldn't see anything wrong, but I did read a little about the .forEach mothod, which sparked some memories. I went back to the code and tried re-factoring it as a .forEach method. Now it wouldn't work at all. Frustrated, I took a look at the suggested solution. I had it almost right. I just needed to move a bracket. I now had a shorter, easier to read, function and a renewed understanding of a method I had forgoten about. Google is an invaluable resource. Any time I'm stuck I know the solution is just a search away. I feel like a bit of a cheat if I resort to it too soon, but I'm not learning anything if I can't figure it out. Better to give up, find the answer and make sure I understand it. That way next time I will figure it out myself.

            <h3>Problem Solving Techniques</h3>
            <ul>
              <li>Pseudocode</li>
              <li>Trying something</li>
              <li>Rubber ducky method</li>
              <li>Reading error messages</li>
              <li>Console.logging</li>
              <li>Googling</li>
              <li>Asking your peers for help</li>
              <li>Asking coaches for help</li>
              <li>Improving your process with reflection</li>
            </ul>

            <p>
              In the list above are a number of problem solving techniques. Some of which I knew about before this sprint, others I had never heard of. All have been usefull in solving the kata problems assigned to my course group this week. I feel confident using them all now and feel there is a natural flow I go through when I get stuck. Starting with Pseudocode to make sure I know what I'm trying to do, then readding error messages and console logging to issolate the issue, trying something to see if I can fix what I found in the console log or error messages, rubber ducky if I'm still stuck, then google to see if I can find a solution. If google fails (more like I fail at google) I know I have peers and coaches I can call apon.
