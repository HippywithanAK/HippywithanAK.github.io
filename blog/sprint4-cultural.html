                Traditionaly it was thought that once adulthood is reached your brain has essentially developed and you are stuck with the skills you have. That you are either naturally good at something or you never will be. Recent studies show this not to be the case. Rather we are able, through repetitive practise, to rewire our brains; strengthening our abilities regardless of our age.  
                <br>
                Repetition of a task causes our brains to fire the neurons, responsable for performing that task, over and over again. This stimulates the neural pathways involved to grow more robust. In turn this makes performing the task progressively easier, as your brain has customized it's infrastructure to make the processing involved progressively more efficient.  This is known as Neuroplasticity. 
              </p>

                Studies have shown that being taught about neuroplasticity before learning something new can help students that might otherwise give up. This is refered to as developing a "Growth Mindset". By embracing a growth mindset; where we are awear of how our brains develop, as we learn; we are less likely to become discouraged by things we find difficult. If we know it will get easier, that we can learn to do it, the struggle seems more worthwhile.
              <br>
              Conversely, if we have a fixed mindset; beleiving that we are good at what we're good at, and bad at what we're bad at, regardless of the effort we put in; we will become easily discouraged and give up before our brains have had a chance to adapt.
