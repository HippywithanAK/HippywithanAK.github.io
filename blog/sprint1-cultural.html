                <h3>Using the evidence gathered, describe your core personal values.</h3>
                <p>My core personal values could be boiled down to the Hippocratic Oath – “First do no harm.” </p>
                <p> I am very permissive of behaviour that doesn’t negatively affect others. When that line is crossed however, I can have a strong emotional response. Likewise, the unnecessary restriction of liberty, which I view as a harmful, in and of itself, triggers within me, a strong sense of injustice.</p> 
                <p> I am very interested in the concept of truth and believe that while it is individual in perspective, it has an objective approximation, constituent of the perspectives with the most evidential corroboration. Ideology without evidence seems self-defeating to me. Logic has a flaw, in that, so long as you accept the assumptions used to describe your wold, that world can be built to support any hypothesis. And this spills into my learning, in that I lose interest quickly in anything that seems to not have practical real world testability or application.</p>
                <p> This desire to know, at least some approximation of, objective truth, along with the knowledge that some things simply cannot be tested in reality, leads me to seek out argument. I can be frustratingly precise in my need to define terms and semantics and I will often push people on points, which can seem aggressive. My argument is generally less geared toward convincing anyone, than it is formulating my own thoughts on a subject. Finding strengths and weaknesses in my current way of thinking, and seeking to understand new perspectives, to complement my own. This can make me come off as stubborn and argumentative.</p>
                <p> I also value understanding. I learn through understanding the way things work. The system and patterns that underlie a skill. I am not great with rote memory, but if I can understand a system and find patterns in the way things work, I will start to remember them.</p>
                <P> I believe my values were heavily influenced by my father’s interest in Eastern Philosophy and Classical Western Philosophy. This peaked an interest in questions of morality, identity, faith and the nature of reality. And in rebellion, atheism, humanism, materialism and nihilism. This interest in philosophy also lead to an interest in political philosophy. The study of which has greatly influenced my core values.</P>

                <h4>Explain a situation where you have had an ethical decision to make. Discuss how you weighed up the values involved in that decision, the decision you made and the consequences of the action you took.</h4>
                <p>A few years ago, I was out of work for about two months. I was running out of money and needed a job desperately. I was going to a lot of interviews but not having any luck. Finally, I got a call back for a follow-up interview. Unfortunately, with a company I had heard some pretty bad things about. </p>
                <p>They basically paid salesmen to drive trucks around poor neighbourhoods, offering them a few hundred dollars credit to spend on the on-board shop. This credit was obviously to be repaid with interest and it was high. They stocked a lot of toys and kids clothes. Mothers would sign up to keep their children warm over winter or buy them Christmas presents. Then be sucked into an endless cycle of need and debt and interest payments.</p>
                <p>My core value at the time was to be able to support myself. To not be a burden on others. And so I compromised what I subsequently came to view as a higher value. I took the job and, for a few months, did what I had to do. I signed people up, sold them shit they didn’t need. Or did, but could get cheaper and without interest if they just went to the warehouse. I told myself I was just doing what I had to get by but deep down I knew I was helping to support a system of institutionalized poverty. That I was preying on the most vulnerable. And it was destroying my sense of who I was and what I stand for.</p>
                <p>Eventually, I couldn’t take it anymore. The thought of visiting a particular customer sent me into a panic attack. I couldn’t continue to justify what I was doing, knowing the consequences and seeing them personally. I quit and asked for help from family, to get me back on my feet.</p>
                <p>I learnt that I couldn’t override my values and that I was stupid to put my shame at asking for help, from people willing to give it, above the wellbeing of others.</p>

                <h4>Describe how your culture has influenced your values and identity.</h4>
                <p>I am of Anglo-Saxon-Celtic decent and culturally Kiwi, with a bit of Britishness. I guess primarily my culture has influenced my values and identity through its philosophical, religious and legal / political traditions. From the Catholic Church to the reformation and the enlightenment, the thinkers of Europe lay the foundations for a lot of the perspectives and insights we take for granted today. Conservative and Liberal. Religious and Humanist. And I like to think I have taken lessons from a good selection. </p>
                <p>I feel there is a growing lack of western identity however. As we become more globally influenced we adopt cultural memes outside of our traditional field of view. As such I have been influenced by Japanese, Korean and Chinese culture amongst others, as well as the cultures of most of the English speaking world, to some degree or another.</p>
                <p>This has led to some fogginess as to my right or need to claim any cultural identity beyond “global citizen” or “Kiwi” which I believe evokes a less mono-cultural identity than most labels of nationality.</p>

                <h3>Using the evidence gathered, describe your strengths and limitations.</h3>
                <p>My strengths lie with my ability to grasp concepts quickly. I am good at seeing how systems work or grasping the core concept behind an idea. My weaknesses seem to stem from a lack of self-confidence and a tendency to second guess myself. So while I will understand concepts, sometimes I will doubt my conclusions. Or fail to take action due to fear of failure.</p>

                <h4>Evaluate your strengths and limitations in terms of your learning and career development</h4>
                <p>My ability to learn quickly is a great asset and will serve me well in this course and my career ahead. It is learning to break down tasks into more manageable chunks that will serve me best. When I can see progress, have something to check off, an order to follow; I have less anxiety around completing something.</p>

                <h4>Identify which of your strengths might help you in your learning journey and how they might intersect with learning obstacles.</h4>
                <p>I tend to be fairly easy to get along with, which should help with co-operative learning. I am quick to understand ideas and can often explain them in a way that is helpful to others.</p>

                <h4>Share an example from your experience of where you were trying to work productively with others, but there was resistance or tension. Discuss the strategies you used at that time, how effective they were, and your reflections on what other strategies you would try now, and why.</h4>
                <p>While working at a job that required a lot of team work and co-operation, I was on a shift with a newish staff member. We were very busy and I was intermittently manning the desk, completing tasks around the workplace and directing my co-workers when necessary. Generally, one person on shift would take charge of directing the team. Usually 2 – 4 people. Sometimes a manager was on shift but most of the time, it was just one of the more experienced team members. At some point I asked my new co-worker to complete a standard task, which he flat out refused. He let me know that he thought I was being controlling and that I wasn’t his boss and so shouldn’t be telling him what to do. </p>
                <p>My initial reaction was to take him aside and give him a piece of my mind. I explained that I had already performed this task multiple times today and it shouldn’t be a big deal for him to do it. And that I was telling him what to do because things needed to be done, I was simply relaying the tasks that needed doing. I had been doing it longer and had a better idea of how things operated. Could complete certain tasks a lot faster, and on a busy day it simply made sense for me to do those tasks while sending him to do things I knew he was confident with. He did not react well. He felt persecuted. Like I was saying he wasn’t capable. I probably came off as cold and accusatory. I was definitely angry. Our working relationship did not recover.</p>
                <p>In the end he was fired. He was not a good worker. In retrospect, I would not have confronted him at all. I would have gone straight to our manager and made a formal complaint. I would have avoided weeks of awkwardness. </p>
                <p>If I did try to talk it out again, I would have taken the time to walk away and let myself calm down. Gone to him from a place of trying to understand how he felt, and then convince him that I was not trying to work against him. Perhaps I could have had a positive influence on him and he would have improved his performance.</p>
